Behaviors
I prioritized building and nurturing strong relationships with my direct teammates, operational partners, and the analytics group within deposits. This focus on collaboration ensured effective communication and alignment across teams, contributing to a culture of cross-functional excellence. By leveraging my subject matter expertise as a Decision Scientist, I provided strategic thought leadership and valuable input on key projects, always maintaining a high level of integrity and trustworthiness.

Additionally, I consistently demonstrated a willingness to collaborate openly, not only within my immediate team but also with stakeholders across the organization. This approach helped to foster a positive and inclusive environment, enabling us to collectively achieve our objectives.
